## 👀 About Me

I'm a graduate student of the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/) at [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) and Prof. [C.L. Philip Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eYZVDSIAAAAJ). I was a visiting student at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) from 2023 to 2024.

I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from South China University of Technology in 2023, graduating with a **GPA of 3.89/4.0**. My research centers on **Efficiency**, encompassing areas such as model compression, efficient architectures, and optimizing pre-training and inference.
