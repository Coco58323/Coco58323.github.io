I am a second-year master student in the Computer Science Department of South China University of Technology (SCUT), advised by Prof. Tony Zhang. I received my B.S. degree from SCUT in 2023 with GPA 3.89/4.0. I was a visiting scholar at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) from 2023 to 2024.

My research interests include **LLM Inference Acceleration**, **Model Quantization**, and **Deep Learning**. I have published 4 first-author papers at top-tier venues (ICLR, ACL, NeurIPS) with **100+ citations**.
